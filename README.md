This repository demonstrates the sensitivity analysis described in 

Liu R., Giordano R., Jordan M. I., Broderick T. “Evaluating Sensitivity to the Stick Breaking Prior in Bayesian Nonparametrics.” *NIPS, All of Bayesian Nonparametrics Workshop.* December 2018.  [https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.06587.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.06587.pdf).

See also, `paragami`, a library for sensitivity analysis in optimization problems:

which is used in the code here. 

This repository is currently undergoing development, as we are porting in our old code to use the Paragami package.
