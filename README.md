This repository demonstrates the sensitivity analysis described in 

Liu R., Giordano R., Jordan M. I., Broderick T. “Evaluating Sensitivity to the Stick Breaking Prior in Bayesian Nonparametrics.” *NIPS, All of Bayesian Nonparametrics Workshop.* December 2018.  [https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.06587.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.06587.pdf).

We use the package `vittles`, a library for sensitivity analysis in optimization problems, see 
[https://vittles-python.readthedocs.io/](https://vittles-python.readthedocs.io/)

which is used in the code here. 

To install the functions in `./BNP_modeling`, run 
`pip install ./`. 

and see `./GMM_modeling/` to reproduce the results of our paper.
